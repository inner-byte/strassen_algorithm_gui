## Introduction

The Strassen's Algorithm GUI is a graphical user interface for performing matrix multiplication using Strassen's Algorithm. It is built using PyQt6 and includes features such as input validation, error handling, process display, and analytics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyQt6
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/inner-byte/strassen_algorithm_gui.git
   cd strassen_algorithm_gui
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install PyQt6 numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Using the Application

### Entering Matrices

1. **Matrix A:**
   - Enter the values for Matrix A in the provided input fields.
   - Ensure that the matrix is square (e.g., 2x2, 4x4).

2. **Matrix B:**
   - Enter the values for Matrix B in the provided input fields.
   - Ensure that the matrix is square and of the same size as Matrix A.

### Multiplying Matrices

1. Once you have entered the matrices, click the "Multiply" button.
2. The application will perform the matrix multiplication using Strassen's Algorithm.
3. The result will be displayed in the output area.

### Viewing the Process

1. To view the detailed steps of the calculation, click the "Show Process" button.
2. A dialog will appear showing the step-by-step process of the matrix multiplication.

### Viewing Analytics

1. To view the time complexity comparison between conventional and Strassen's algorithms, click the "Show Analytics" button.
2. A dialog will appear showing the analytics and comparison.

## Example Matrices

Here are example matrices A and B used for multiplication:

**Matrix A:**
```
[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8],
 [9, 10, 11, 12],
 [13, 14, 15, 16]]
```

**Matrix B:**
```
[[16, 15, 14, 13],
 [12, 11, 10, 9],
 [8, 7, 6, 5],
 [4, 3, 2, 1]]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Matrix Size Mismatch:**
   - Ensure that both matrices are square and of the same size.

2. **Invalid Input:**
   - Ensure that all input fields contain valid numerical values.

3. **Application Crashes:**
   - Check the terminal for error messages and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
