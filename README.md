Strassen's Algorithm GUI

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing matrix multiplication using Strassen's Algorithm. It is built using PyQt6 and includes features such as input validation, error handling, process display, and analytics.

 Features

- Matrix Input: Enter matrices A and B for multiplication.
- Matrix Multiplication: Perform matrix multiplication using Strassen's Algorithm.
- Process Display: View the detailed steps of the calculation.
- Analytics: Compare the time complexity between conventional and Strassen's algorithms.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyQt6
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/inner-byte/strassen_algorithm_gui.git
   cd strassen_algorithm_gui
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install PyQt6 numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

 Running the Application

1. Run the application:
